*Hey, I’m **Akhilesh (Avi)** — a software engineer who likes building real things that people actually use.*

- 🧠 **Lead engineer behind [Teachanything.ai](https://teachanything.ai)** (formerly AI Alexa) — an open-source, production RAG platform that lets professors design their own AI teaching assistants. Used globally, grant-backed, and recently featured in *The New York Times*.
- 🏛️ Building AI tools for education and digital humanities @ **GW Digital Humanities Institute**, working closely with faculty on AI literacy, retrieval systems, and academic guardrails.
- <img src="https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo/blob/main/showcase/src/public/logo/icon/Octo-Icon.png" style="width: 18px;"/> **Founding engineer @ [tambo](https://tambo.co)** — working on AI-native UX, a CLI for installing AI components, and a React component system for generative interfaces.
- <img src="https://github.com/jamesmurdza/gitwit-dev/blob/main/public/favicons/dark/android-chrome-512x512.png" style="width: 18px;" /> **Core contributor @ [GitWit](https://gitwit.dev)** — built infra for AI codegen, ReactEval for automated testing, and an open-source sandboxed cloud IDE.
- 🔭 Currently obsessed with **developer tools, RAG systems, and generative UI** — especially things that blur the line between product and interface.
- 📫 Reach me at **[akhileshrangani4@gmail.com](mailto:akhileshrangani4@gmail.com)**  
- 💬 Happy to chat about AI systems, startups, devtools, or just building stuff end-to-end.
